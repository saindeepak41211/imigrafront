        <h5 className='center'>HOW TO APPLY FOR A STUDENT VISA TO STUDY ABROAD?</h5>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>Get to know the visa requirements-&nbsp;</strong>Different countries have varying visa requirements, the embassy of the nation you want to study in should be your first stop.</p>

        <p><strong>Identify the visa you should apply for-&nbsp;</strong>The actual name and type of visa you’ll need varies by nation, but you’ll certainly need a non-immigrant student/study visa. This basically suggests that you do not intend to stay in that nation permanently and that your stay is only for the purpose of studying.</p>
        <p>You may require proof of your place on a program from the university or college you plan to attend before you apply for your visa.</p>
        <p><strong>Get the required papers from your university-&nbsp;</strong>Contact the university or college to find out the visa you need to apply and/or to request that they send you the appropriate papers.</p>
        <p><strong>Make your application</strong>– You should be ready to apply once your university or college has advised you of the suitable visa you need &nbsp;and any papers you require &nbsp;to submit. Ask how to apply for a visa at your host country’s embassy or consulate, or browse their website.</p>
        <p>If fraudulent information was provided or crucial facts were omitted throughout the application process, the visa will be revoked.</p>
        <p><strong>Processing time-&nbsp;</strong>Depending on the country and your nationality, visa processing can take anything from a&nbsp;few days to 3 months.&nbsp;Make sure you give yourself enough time to get your visa in order, since rushing an application is not recommended and may result in you losing your spot.</p>
